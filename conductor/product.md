# Initial Concept
A system for managing electronic component catalogs, allowing for hierarchical categorization, specification search, and automated datasheet generation using Typst and LaTeX.

# Product Guide

## Overview
Foundational Electronics Core Systems is a specialized platform designed for the electronics industry to manage complex component data and automate the creation of technical documentation. It bridges the gap between raw catalog data and professional-grade datasheets.

## Target Users
- **Catalog Managers:** Responsible for maintaining the hierarchy of electronic components, products, and custom attributes.
- **Product Engineers:** Use the system to search for specific components based on technical specifications and generate standardized documentation.
- **Technical Writers:** Manage document templates (Typst/LaTeX) to ensure consistent branding and layout across all generated PDFs.

## Core Features
- **Hierarchical Catalog Management:** Organize components into categories and series with inheritance of attributes.
- **Specification Search:** Advanced filtering of components based on dynamic custom fields and facets.
- **Automated Datasheet Generation:** Generate PDFs in real-time using Typst (preferred) or LaTeX, injecting live catalog data into pre-defined templates.
- **Template Management:** Create and manage global or series-specific templates with live preview and variable injection.
- **Data Portability:** Export and import catalog data via CSV for bulk updates and synchronization.

## Goals
- Centralize component data into a single source of truth.
- Reduce the time and manual effort required to produce technical datasheets.
- Ensure data consistency across all customer-facing documentation.
