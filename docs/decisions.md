Decisions Log
=============

- 2025-11-24: Do not adopt Composer/PSR-4; stay with manual autoload/require.
- 2025-11-24: No special deployment constraints provided (treat as standard PHP hosting with writable `storage/`).
- 2025-11-24: Keep existing CSV/LaTeX flows; wrap them in services without altering behavior.
- 2025-11-24: Frontend must use Bootstrap 5 + DataTables; jQuery usage must be encapsulated in ES6 classes.
